# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

Using addEventListener and getElementbyId to access and update DOM elements in this project really helped me understand DOM interation works.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?

I chose my milestone messages based on the suggested messages, and I also added some humor.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?

A challenge creating this was that I'm completely new to HTML and CSS, so it was tricky to figure out how to style and format the elements the way I wanted.

## What personal twist did you add?

A personal twist that I added was pop-up cat GIFs at milestone 50 and 100.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

One example is Instagram because when you click like on someone's post the like count updates immediately to reflect it.
